# PHP SOAP Project
A PHP SOAP project created for the Web Services course in my 3rd year of bachelor in DKIT

Here some cars have been used as data example

## File structure
Because the project has been made with a unique Apache server both `requestor` and `provider` apps should be in same root directory
```
.
├── provider/
│   ├── cars.wsdl
│   └── index.php 
└── requestor/
    ├── index.html
    └── requests.php
```
